# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains reports and models of projects of Aethrone Aerospace:

## 1. **Vehicle CO₂ Emissions Prediction (Problem Statement 1)**

**Objective:**  
Build and evaluate regression models to predict CO₂ emissions based on vehicle attributes like engine size, fuel consumption, and cylinders. The models are evaluated using metrics like MAE, RSS, and R² score. The project also covers data cleaning, correlation analysis, and comparative evaluation of different regression models.

**Key Steps:**
- Data cleaning and handling missing/erroneous data
- Normalization/standardization
- Correlation analysis
- Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, etc.)
- Model evaluation

## 2. **Aerial Image Object Detection for Maritime Environment (Problem Statement 3)**

**Objective:**  
Generate bounding box annotations for images of maritime environments. Implement an object detection model to classify objects like boats, cars, and jetskis. The project also includes merging certain categories and evaluating the model's performance.

**Key Steps:**
- Image annotation for object detection
- Model implementation and fine-tuning
- Comparative analysis between models with different categories
